This Perl script accepts Email messages on STDIN, parses out the
attachments, and then saves them somewhere.  To use with the 
Postfix mail server, place the script somehwere and give it
appropriate permissions to be executed by the Postfix user.  Be
sure to edit the script itself to change any configuration 
variables for your system, and make sure that any directories
it is to write to have the appropriate permissions set.  (For
Postfix, this is nobody.)

When this is done, add a line like this to your aliases file,
usually /etc/postfix/aliases:

  script@domain.com:"|/path/to/attachments.pl"
  
Then, run newaliases at the commandline.  Note that at this
time, any email sent to this script will be processed, so
you might want to make the address something obscure.  To use
with other mail servers, please see the appropriate documentation.

See this page for the inspiration for this script:
  http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=195442

On Debian, install libmime-perl.  This will install the 
required Perl modules.

Note that this script includes some safeguards regarding security,
however at this stage using it in production may not be wise.
In the future better security measures could be added to, for instnace,
prevent a malicious user from taking up disk space by mailing too
many large attachments.  However, for now the ability to whitelist
Emails and limit the number and size of attachments is provided.

Do NOT run this file as root!

An example whitelist is given, but this can be any file as long as
the format is one Email address per line.  Edit the script to give
the location of this file.
